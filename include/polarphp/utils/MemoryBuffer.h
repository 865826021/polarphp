/// This interface provides simple read-only access to a block of memory, and
/// provides simple methods for reading files and standard input into a memory
/// buffer.  In addition to basic access to the characters in the file, this
/// interface guarantees you can read one character past the end of the file,
/// and that this character will read as '\0'.
///
/// The '\0' guarantee is needed to support an optimization -- it's intended to
/// be more efficient for clients which are reading all the data to stop
/// reading when they encounter a '\0' than to continually check the file
/// position to see if it has reached the end of the file.
